Commands are created and configured as instances the =process.Command= class:
#+begin_src shell
  cmd = {
      process.Command \
          (echo a b c) \
          cwd?="path | string" \
          1=$os.fd.stdout \
          2=$os.fd.stderr \
          ...moreFileDescriptors
  }
#+end_src
Running a command creates a process:
#+begin_src shell
  p = {cmd.run "process name"}
#+end_src
=process.run= is a simple utility that runs a command in simple terms and waits
for it to finish, returning a description of the process output how the process ended.
#+begin_src shell
  process.run cat /some/file.txt
#+end_src
