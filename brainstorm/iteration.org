Ways to loop and iterate over data in MyLang.

The iteration functions like =for=, =loop=, etc return an object that can hold the
values optionally collected during the iteration, using the =collect= function.

#+begin_src shell
  positive_numbers = {
      for x in -10..10 (
          if $x > 0 (
              collect 1
          )
      )
  }
#+end_src
